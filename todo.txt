// 1 / register a user
2 / login a user
3 / who iam 
// refresh tokes

4 / add a new product
5 / get all product
6 / get single product
7/ delete  a user

why refresh token we use

after successful submission of the user password and email the user get a access_token to get the value of some 
protected resources but the problem is the validity of this access_token is low (60s) after 60s the user needs to log in
again so it is a bad user experians
